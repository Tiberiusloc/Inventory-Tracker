#### Tiberius Lockett

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Node Package Manager
* React
* CSS
* HTML

## Description
This application was created to show understanding of building single page web apps with React js Library. This application contains full CRUD functionality, allowing the user to:
  - track how many coffee beans are left in a Burlap Sack
  - add new types of Coffee
  - update Coffee
  - delete Coffee
  - sell pounds of coffee by 1 pound 
  - add restock/ restock is around 130 lbs

Requested User Specifications (user stories):
  - As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available coffee. For each Burlap Sack of Coffee, I want to see its name, origin, roast, price.
  - As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new coffee to a list.
  - As a user, I want to be able to click on a coffee to see its detail page.
  - As a user, I want to see how many pounds are left in a coffee Burlap Sack. A full coffee Burlap Sack has roughly 130 pounds.
  - As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a coffee whenever I sell a pound of it. This should decrease the number of pounds by 1. Pounds should not be able to go below 0.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
